Improvements to documentation

=item 0.11 - not released

Made the default -fetchrow_closure an explicit method default_fetchrow_closure()
so it can be used by subclasses.

Config option -href_extra_vars now supports HASHREF syntax.

Better documentation: eg. defaults for config options.

Refactored some code into smaller methods for better readability/maintainability.

Support reverse sorting if user clicks on current sortby column.

Bugfix: show Prev/Next links even if -show_total_numresults config option not set
