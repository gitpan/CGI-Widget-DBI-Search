- remove HTML which control style (e.g. width, height, nowrap, <b>, etc) and
  CSS classes everywhere, and add a default CSS stylesheet
- add Terms of Use link to AGPL on user-visible pages
- add search functionality to widget: right now its more of just a
  "result pager" widget, with the actual search code in the calling class
- convert to DB abstraction layer, e.g. Alzabo or Tangram
  (would be nice to have some performance tests written for comparisons
   before this is done though)
